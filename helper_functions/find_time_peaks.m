% ##### Declared Inputs: [[[NEEDS UPDATES!!!]]]
%
%           The following variables are derived from
%           find_frequency_peaks.m
%
%           - prominence_curve: This is the prominence of the peaks
%                               detected on the normalized spectrum at
%                               each time slice.
%
%           - ffreq:            The frequency of the peaks detected on the
%                               normalized spectrum at each time slice.
%
%           - fwidth:           The width of the peaks detected on the
%                               normalized spectrum at each time slice.
%
%           The following variable can be generated from the multitaper
%           spectrogram function:
%
%           - stimes:           The time axis vector as used in multitaper
%                               spectrogram estimation. This vector has the
%                               same length as prominence_curve, ffreq, and
%                               fwidth. Each sample is the time in seconds
%                               for the center of the window used to
%                               compute one time slice of the spectrogram.
%                               This vector should be in seconds.
%
%           Other Parameters:
%
%           - stages:           Scored sleep stages as a vector. All motion
%                               artifacts should already be marked as
%                               periods of wake prior to calling this
%                               function. This is important for detecting
%                               spindles during only NREM segments.
%
%           - stage_times:      The is the vector of times at which every
%                               new stage starts. This should be in
%                               seconds.

% ##### Optional Inputs:
%
%           - 'smooth_sec':         The number of seconds to smooth the
%                                   prominence curve by. This is
%                                   implemented with movmean.m
%                                   default: [0.3]
%
%           - 'only_NREM':          A boolean specifying whether only to
%                                   detect peaks in prominence curve during
%                                   NREM sleep stages. If false, peaks are
%                                   also detected during REM sleep.
%                                   default: True
%
%           - 'MinPeakWidth_sec':   The minimum peak width required for a
%                                   peak to be detected by findpeaks. It
%                                   is specified in seconds. Can be
%                                   adjusted to prevent detecting tiny
%                                   noisy peaks. A default value of 0.3 is
%                                   chosen considering smoothing and the
%                                   literature assumption of sleep spindles
%                                   having durations in the range 0.3-3s. 
%                                   default: [0.3]
%
%           - 'MinPeakDistance_sec':The minimum distance between detected
%                                   peaks in findpeaks. It is specified in
%                                   seconds. Peak distance is measured from
%                                   peak to peak. This corresponds to prior
%                                   assumption about silence period between
%                                   peaks. This parameter should match
%                                   the step size and time window
%                                   parameters in multitaper spectrogram.
%                                   If a multitaper spectrogram is
%                                   estimated with window lenth of 1s, then
%                                   it is difficult to interpret two peaks
%                                   that are less than 0.5s apart. However,
%                                   default is set to be 0s here because
%                                   usually this parameter doesn't change
%                                   results by much.
%                                   default: [0]
%
%           - 'report_width_scale': This parameter determines the
%                                   conversion from half height width of
%                                   detected peaks on the prominence curve
%                                   to start and end times of possible
%                                   spindle candidates. The spindle start
%                                   and end times are derived as
%
%                                   tpeak_time - (report_width_scale*half_height_width)
%                                                       ~
%                                   tpeak_time + (report_width_scale*half_height_width)
%
%                                   thus, if report_width_scale is set to
%                                   be 0.5, the width of detected peak will
%                                   have the same width as the half height
%                                   width.
%                                   default = [0.5];

% ##### Outputs:

%                               This will be the a 2 column vector in the
%                               format: [start_times, end_times]. The times
%                               are calculated based on the
%                               report_width_scale.
%
%           - tpeak_widths:     The width of peaks detected in

%                               are reported in seconds.
%
%           - fwidth_at_tpeak:  The width of maximal spectral peak at the
%                               time slice of a peak detected in the
%                               prominence curve.
%
%           - sd_ffreq:         The standard deviation of the frequencies
%                               of spectral peaks in the time slices where
%                               a peak is detected in the prominence value.
%                               These values are computed using ffreqs
%                               from find_spectrogram_peaks.m
%
%           - sd_fwidth:        The standard deviation of the width of
%                               spectral peaks in the time slices where a
%                               peak is detected in the prominence value.
%                               These values are computed using fwidth
%                               from find_spectrogram_peaks.m
%
%           - ffreq_at_tpeak:   The frequency of maximal spectral peak at
%                               the time slice of a peak detected in the
%                               prominence curve.
%
%           - tpeak_intervals:  Intervals between tpeaks, calculated as end
%                               time of previous peak to start time of next
%                               peak. This is the upper bound for
%                               peakdistance, which is calculated from peak
%                               to peak.
